# See https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/ for information about what
# commands you can use in this file.
#
# Note that you must use the `docker stack deploy` command, with any required
# command line flags, in order to actually get any replicas started. That
# command requires that a docker swarm is already running in order to function.
